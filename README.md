# MPA (Moon Position Algorithm)

Based on SAMPA (Solar And Moon Position Algorithm) and SPA (Solar Position
Algorithm), downloaded from the US Department of Energy, stripped to the
barest essentials for the moon, and ported to C++.

SPA and SAMPA were written in 2003 and 2012, respectively, by Afshin Michael
Andreas (Afshin.Andreas@NREL.gov), Measurement & Instrumentation Team, Solar
Radiation Research Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
They were based on the NREL technical report "Solar Position Algorithm for
Solar Radiation Application" by Ibrahim Reda & Afshin Andreas, and the NREL
technical report "Solar Eclipse Monitoring for Solar Energy Applications
using the Solar and Moon Position Algorithms" by Ibrahim Reda.
